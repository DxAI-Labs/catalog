```
You're a game designer and want to play Sudoku now.

Create a version that's based on modern game app design principles.

I want to play it as a single webpage using the latest capabilities of CSS that I host on my computer's dekstop named sudoku.html. It should be able to accept mouse and keynote inputs.

Make sure you can my scores using local storage.
