```
Context:
I'm creating a minimal todo app with a minimal synthwave modern productivity app aesthetic that helps users focus without distraction.

Objective:
Generate code for a todo list component that supports adding, completing, and filtering tasks.

Vibe Direction:
The app should feel minimal and intentional like a well designed Muji paper notebook. Interactions should be gentle and predictable, creating a sense of calm productivity.

Technical Parameters:
- Use vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS (no frameworks)
- Support local storage for persistence
- Ensure it works well on both desktop and mobile
- Keep performance lightweight and fast

Visual Reference:
Use subtle contruction paper textured background, complimentary colors, and a whiteboarding inspired font. Elements should have slight asymmetry or imperfection to feel human-made rather than digital.

Additional Notes:
Avoid notification sounds that might disrupt the calm feeling. Animation should be minimal and subtle.
